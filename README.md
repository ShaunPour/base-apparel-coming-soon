## My process

My process is what a lot of people would call "very very boring" as it involves me setting up a basic structure and then just tweaking the numbers for positioning elements bit by bit until I get it right. Javascript is fairly similar just with some more googling or youtubing if I'm doing something I don't remember the exact lines of code to achieve.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The primary use of this project was the continuation of my improvement at doing css better as well as starting to incorporate some javascript into that css in the form of verifying that the email contains an @ symbol and that their is an email.
